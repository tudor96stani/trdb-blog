Hi, I'm Tudor. I'm a software engineer based in Romania. 

I've been working as a dotnet backend developer since mid 2018, in the medical software industry.

I've created this blog as a way for me to more easily track the progress I am making through my pet project on learning Rust and implementing a database system.

Other than databases, my other big software related passion is compilers - maybe one day I will start working on one of those again.

My other passions include sports - I like running and swimming. I do quite a bit of reading & spend a lot of time watching Youtube videos about HiFi audio systems I will never afford.
